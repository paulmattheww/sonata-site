            <strong>Sonata</strong> — Piano Learning App<br>
            Effective Date: February 27, 2026 &middot; Last Updated: February 27, 2026
        </p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Sonata stores all your data locally on your device. We do not collect personal information, track your activity, or share data with third parties. Your practice statistics, favorites, and progress never leave your device.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p><strong>We do not collect personal information.</strong> Sonata is designed to work entirely offline. All data generated by your use of the app is stored locally on your device:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Practice data</strong> — session duration, accuracy scores, notes hit, streak counts, and mastery levels are stored in a local database (SQLite) on your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Preferences</strong> — favorites, settings, and curriculum progress are stored in local device storage (SharedPreferences).</li>
            <li><strong>MIDI and microphone input</strong> — audio and MIDI data from your keyboard or microphone is processed in real-time on your device and is never recorded, stored, or transmitted.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <p>Sonata does <strong>not</strong> collect, transmit, or store:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Names, email addresses, or account information</li>
            <li>Location data</li>
            <li>Device identifiers or advertising IDs</li>
            <li>Usage analytics or behavioral data</li>
            <li>Crash reports (unless you opt in via Apple's built-in crash reporting)</li>
            <li>Any data from your microphone or MIDI keyboard beyond real-time processing</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The current version of Sonata does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. If we add such services in a future update, this privacy policy will be updated and you will be notified.</p>
        <p>Sonata uses Apple's StoreKit framework to process in-app purchases. Payment information is handled entirely by Apple and is subject to <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>. We do not receive or store your payment details.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>All user data is stored locally on your device using:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>SQLite database</strong> (via Drift ORM) — for practice sessions, streak logs, and piece mastery data</li>
            <li><strong>SharedPreferences</strong> — for app settings and lightweight preferences</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is protected by your device's built-in security (device passcode, Face ID, Touch ID). If you delete the app, all locally stored data is permanently removed.</p>

        <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Sonata does not collect personal information from any user, including children. The app does not require an account, does not ask for personal details, and does not include advertising. Parents and guardians can feel confident that their children's privacy is protected.</p>
        <p>Sonata is not directed at children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete that information promptly.</p>

        <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Because all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access:</strong> All your data is visible within the app (Profile screen, practice statistics).</li>
            <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Uninstalling the app permanently deletes all stored data.</li>
            <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Your data exists only on your device and is not transmitted to any server.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page and notify users through the app. Your continued use of Sonata after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
